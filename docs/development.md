* To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
* To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Installation

    $ gem install word-search-puzzle

If bundler is being used to manage dependencies, install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:
